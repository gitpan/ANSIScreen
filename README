INTRODUCTION

  Term::ANSIScreen, originally named Term::ANSI, was intended as an
  extension to Term::ANSIColor, which is a part of standard distribution.

  After consulting Term::ANSIColor's authors, its name had been
  changed to avoid conflicts with the original module. Basically,
  Term::ANSIScreen provides the same functionality as Term::ANSIColor
  (up to v1.03), as well as screen mode, cursor control and keyboard
  mapping sequences.

  The author (Autrijus Tang) is aware that the additional features are
  largely superseded by Win32::Console and Curse-based modules, but
  decides to put up this for the poor souls still using ANSI.SYS on
  DOSish platforms.

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features, and usage.


INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  If instead you wish to
  install the module by hand, simply copy it into a directory named Term in
  your Perl library directory.
